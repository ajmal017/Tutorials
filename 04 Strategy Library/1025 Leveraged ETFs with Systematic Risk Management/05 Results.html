    We compare our results to the SP500 Benchmark, for which we use SPY, over a five year period. For some years,
    our algorithm outperforms, but for other years, the algorithm is beaten by SPY, and the returns just slightly beat SPY
    in final ROI. The algorithm produced a CAGR of 11.49% during the five years.
